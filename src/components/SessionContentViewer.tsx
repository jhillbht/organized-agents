# Single Agent Basics

Welcome to your first session in the Agent Journey Academy! In this foundational session, you'll learn the core concepts of working with AI agents.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of software development, agents like Claude can:

- Read and write code
- Execute commands
- Analyze codebases
- Generate documentation
- Debug issues
- And much more!

## Key Concepts

### 1. Agent Communication
The key to successful agent interaction is clear, specific communication. Instead of vague requests, provide detailed instructions with context.

**Good**: "Please create a Python function that validates email addresses using regex, with proper error handling and unit tests."

**Bad**: "Make an email validator."

### 2. Context Awareness
Agents work best when they understand the full context of what you're trying to achieve. Always provide:
- Project background
- Current state
- Desired outcome
- Any constraints or requirements

### 3. Iterative Improvement
Don't expect perfection on the first try. Work iteratively with the agent, providing feedback and refinements.

## Practical Exercise

You'll practice these concepts by working with Claude Code to create a simple "Hello World" application with proper documentation and testing.

# Basic Workflows

Workflows are the foundation of effective agent coordination. They allow you to create structured, repeatable processes that combine multiple agent capabilities.

## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a sequence of connected tasks that agents execute to achieve a larger goal. Think of it as a recipe that breaks down complex projects into manageable steps.

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Sequential Workflows
Tasks executed one after another:
\`\`\`
Step 1: Agent analyzes requirements
Step 2: Agent creates initial code
Step 3: Agent adds tests
Step 4: Agent generates documentation
\`\`\`

### 2. Conditional Workflows
Paths that change based on conditions:
\`\`\`
If (language === "Python"):
  → Use Python-specific agent
Else if (language === "JavaScript"):
  → Use JavaScript-specific agent
\`\`\`

### 3. Iterative Workflows
Repeated tasks until criteria are met:
\`\`\`
While (tests are failing):
  → Agent fixes failing tests
  → Agent runs test suite
\`\`\`

## Building Your First Workflow

Start with a simple "Code Review Workflow":
1. Agent reads the code
2. Agent identifies potential issues
3. Agent suggests improvements
4. Agent generates a summary report

## Error Handling

Always include error handling:
- Timeouts for long-running tasks
- Fallback options when agents fail
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Recovery strategies for common failures

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows modular and reusable
- Document each step clearly
- Test workflows with different inputs
- Monitor execution and performance
- Version control your workflow definitions

Each agent needs clear responsibilities:
\`\`\`json
{
  "developer_agent": {
    "role": "Primary code implementation",
    "focus": "Feature development, bug fixes",
    "tools": ["code_editor", "test_runner"]
  },
  "reviewer_agent": {
    "role": "Code quality assurance",
    "focus": "Best practices, security, performance",
    "tools": ["static_analyzer", "documentation"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Communication Protocols
Establish clear communication patterns:
- **Status Updates**: Regular progress reports

- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling disagreements
- **Handoff Procedures**: Smooth work transitions

## Advanced Coordination Techniques

### Context Sharing
Ensure both agents have necessary context:
- Project requirements and constraints
- Coding standards and conventions
- Previous decisions and their rationale
- Current project state and progress

### Parallel Processing
Coordinate simultaneous work:
- **Code Generation**: One writes tests, other writes implementation
- **Research Tasks**: One investigates solutions, other prepares environment
- **Documentation**: One codes, other documents

### Quality Gates
Implement checkpoints where both agents must agree:
- Design decisions
- Architecture choices
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations

## Managing Agent Disagreements

When agents disagree:
1. **Clarify the disagreement**: Understand different perspectives
2. **Evaluate trade-offs**: Consider pros and cons of each approach
3. **Make an informed decision**: You have the final say
4. **Document the decision**: Record rationale for future reference

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

# Handoff Patterns

Effective handoffs are crucial for multi-agent workflows. Learn to create seamless transitions that preserve context and maintain momentum.

## Types of Handoffs

### 1. Sequential Handoffs
Linear progression through agents:
\`\`\`
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Completion
\`\`\`

### 2. Conditional Handoffs
Route based on conditions:
\`\`\`
Agent A analyzes → 
  If (simple task) → Agent B (fast processor)
  If (complex task) → Agent C (specialized expert)
\`\`\`

### 3. Parallel-to-Serial Handoffs
Multiple agents converge to one:
\`\`\`
Agent A (frontend) →
Agent B (backend)  → Agent D (integration)
Agent C (database) →
\`\`\`

### 4. Fan-out Handoffs
One agent distributes to many:
\`\`\`
Agent A (coordinator) → Agent B (task 1)
                      → Agent C (task 2)
                      → Agent D (task 3)
\`\`\`

## Handoff Protocol Design

### Information Package
Each handoff should include:
- **Current State**: What has been accomplished
- **Context**: Background and requirements
- **Next Steps**: Specific tasks for receiving agent
- **Resources**: Files, data, and tools needed
- **Constraints**: Deadlines, requirements, limitations

### Handoff Checklist
\`\`\`
□ Work completed and verified
□ Results documented and accessible
□ Context preserved and transferred
□ Next agent notified and ready
□ Fallback plan in place
\`\`\`

## Context Preservation Strategies

### 1. Shared Memory Systems
Centralized information storage:
- Project state database
- Shared file systems
- Configuration repositories
- Decision logs

### 2. Explicit Documentation
Clear communication through:
- Handoff documents
- Code comments
- README updates
- Decision records

### 3. Live Context Transfer
Real-time information sharing:
- Agent conversation logs
- Screen sharing sessions
- Live document editing
- Instant messaging

## Error Recovery in Handoffs

### Common Handoff Failures
- **Context Loss**: Information not properly transferred
- **Agent Unavailability**: Receiving agent not ready
- **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple agents accessing same resources
- **Communication Breakdown**: Messages lost or misunderstood

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Timeout Handling**: What happens when agents don't respond
2. **Rollback Procedures**: How to undo incomplete handoffs
3. **Alternative Routing**: Backup agents and paths
4. **Manual Intervention**: When and how humans should step in

## Optimizing Handoff Performance

### Reduce Handoff Overhead
- Minimize context transfer size
- Pre-position common resources
- Use efficient communication protocols
- Cache frequently accessed information

### Parallel Preparation
- Prepare receiving agents in advance
- Pre-load necessary resources
- Validate readiness before handoff
- Queue work for immediate processing

## Advanced Handoff Patterns

### Staged Handoffs
Break complex handoffs into stages:
1. **Preparation Stage**: Ready resources and context
2. **Transfer Stage**: Move work and information
3. **Validation Stage**: Confirm successful transfer
4. **Activation Stage**: Begin work on receiving end

### Bidirectional Handoffs
Allow agents to hand work back:
- For clarification requests
- When encountering blocking issues
- For specialized sub-tasks
- For quality review cycles

### Conditional Completion
Handoffs that adapt based on results:
- Success path vs. failure path
- Quality-based routing decisions
- Resource-dependent next steps
- Time-sensitive alternatives

  Agent D → Combine all results
\`\`\`

### 3. Pipeline Parallelism
Overlapping stages of work:
\`\`\`
Stage 1: Agent A prepares input
Stage 2: Agent B processes (while A prepares next)
Stage 3: Agent C finalizes (while B processes next)
\`\`\`

### 4. Fork-Join Patterns
Split work, then reunite:
\`\`\`
Fork: Coordinator assigns tasks to multiple agents
Work: Agents execute in parallel
Join: Coordinator collects and integrates results
\`\`\`

   - Allocate resources
   - Set milestones

6. Monitoring & Adaptation
   - Track progress
   - Detect deviations
   - Adjust as needed
\`\`\`

### Learning Organizations
Systems that improve over time:

- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing optimization processes

## Scalable Architecture Patterns

### Microservices for Agents
\`\`\`
Agent Microservice Architecture:
├── Agent Registry Service
├── Communication Bus Service
├── Task Queue Service
├── Resource Manager Service
├── Monitoring Service
├── Configuration Service
└── Individual Agent Services
    ├── Agent A (Stateless)
    ├── Agent B (Stateless)
    └── Agent C (Stateless)
\`\`\`

### Event-Driven Architecture
\`\`\`
Event Flow:
Task Created → Task Queue → Agent Pool → 
Task Processing → Status Updates → 
Completion Event → Result Storage → 
Notification Event → User/System
\`\`\`

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Command Side**: Handle agent actions and state changes
- **Query Side**: Provide read-optimized views
- **Event Store**: Capture all state changes as events
- **Projections**: Create specialized views from events

### Saga Orchestration
Long-running workflows with compensation:
\`\`\`
Saga Example: Software Release
1. Build Agent → Code Compilation
2. Test Agent → Quality Validation
3. Security Agent → Vulnerability Scan
4. Deploy Agent → Production Release
5. Monitor Agent → Performance Tracking

Compensation Chain (if failure):
- Rollback Deployment
- Revert Configuration
- Notify Stakeholders
- Update Status
\`\`\`

## Performance and Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling Strategies
- **Agent Pool Scaling**: Add/remove agent instances
- **Workload Partitioning**: Distribute work by type/region
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests evenly
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatic capacity adjustment

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Layers**: Reduce redundant computation
- **Result Memoization**: Cache expensive operations
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources on demand

### Resource Management
\`\`\`
Resource Allocation Strategy:
├── CPU Pool (Compute-intensive agents)
├── Memory Pool (Data-intensive agents)
├── I/O Pool (Network/disk-intensive agents)
├── GPU Pool (ML/AI-intensive agents)
└── Reserved Pool (Critical system agents)
\`\`\`

## Enterprise Integration Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern
Centralized access point for agent services:
- **Authentication**: Verify caller identity
- **Authorization**: Check access permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
- **Request Routing**: Direct to appropriate agents
- **Response Transformation**: Format outputs

### Event Sourcing
Capture all changes as immutable events:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of changes
- **Replay Capability**: Reconstruct system state
- **Temporal Queries**: State at any point in time
- **Debugging**: Trace issues through event history

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Prevent cascade failures:
\`\`\`
Circuit States:
- Closed: Normal operation
- Open: Fail fast, block requests
- Half-Open: Test if service recovered

Thresholds:
- Failure Rate: > 50% failures
- Response Time: > 5 seconds
- Volume: Minimum requests before evaluation
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing
Track requests across multiple agents:
\`\`\`
Trace Example:
Span 1: API Gateway (5ms)
├── Span 2: Auth Service (10ms)
├── Span 3: Task Router (3ms)
├── Span 4: Agent A (150ms)
│   ├── Span 5: Database Query (45ms)
│   └── Span 6: External API (80ms)
└── Span 7: Response Formatter (8ms)
Total: 181ms
\`\`\`

### Metrics and KPIs
Track system health and performance:
- **Technical Metrics**: Response time, throughput, errors
- **Business Metrics**: Task completion rate, quality scores
- **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Agent Metrics**: Utilization, success rate, efficiency

### Real-time Dashboards
\`\`\`
Dashboard Components:
├── System Overview
│   ├── Active Agents
│   ├── Queue Depth
│   ├── Throughput
│   └── Error Rate
├── Performance Metrics
│   ├── Response Times
│   ├── Resource Usage
│   ├── Bottlenecks
│   └── Trends
└── Business Metrics
    ├── Task Completion
    ├── Quality Scores
    ├── User Satisfaction
    └── ROI Metrics
\`\`\`

## Governance and Compliance

### Agent Lifecycle Management
- **Registration**: Onboard new agents
- **Certification**: Validate agent capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Track agent performance
- **Updates**: Deploy new versions
- **Retirement**: Gracefully remove agents

### Compliance Framework
