- **Coordination**: Bridges different AI capabilities for optimal outcomes

### Review Mastery Agent
**Purpose**: Code review and quality assurance
- **Specialty**: Security analysis, performance review, best practices enforcement
- **Best For**: Maintaining code quality, knowledge transfer, standards compliance
- **Coordination**: Final quality gate before production deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Utility Agents (Legacy from Claudia)

### Git Commit Bot
**Purpose**: Automated version control
- **Specialty**: Commit message generation, branch management, merge conflict resolution
- **Legacy**: Original Claudia agent, enhanced for Organized Agents workflows

### Security Scanner
**Purpose**: Security analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Specialty**: OWASP compliance, dependency vulnerabilities, security best practices
- **Legacy**: Comprehensive security analysis, upgraded with enterprise features

### Unit Tests Bot
**Purpose**: Automated test generation
- **Specialty**: Unit test creation, test coverage analysis, mock generation
- **Legacy**: Focused testing agent, now integrated with Testing Revolution Agent

## üî• Parallel Coordination Patterns

### Foundation Pattern (Weeks 1-11)
**Single Agent Mastery**
- Start with Environmental Mastery Agent
- Master one agent completely before adding others
- Build confidence and understanding

### Pair Pattern (Weeks 12-15)
**Two-Agent Workflows**
- **Classic Pair**: Debug Mastery + Testing Revolution
- **Architecture Pair**: Codebase Mastery + Documentation Revolution
- **DevOps Pair**: Environmental Mastery + Git Commit Bot

### Team Pattern (Weeks 16-19)
**Multi-Agent Orchestration**
- **Quality Team**: Testing Revolution + Debug Mastery + Review Mastery
- **Architecture Team**: Codebase Mastery + Documentation Revolution + Environmental Mastery
- **Coordination Team**: Parallel Planning + Connection Mastery + Gemini Orchestrator

### Orchestra Pattern (Weeks 20-22)
**Full Enterprise Deployment**
- All 12 agents working simultaneously
- Parallel Planning Agent as conductor
- Connection Mastery Agent managing communications
- Real-time coordination across complex projects

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Beginner: Single Agent
```bash
# Start with Environmental Mastery
organized-agents launch environmental-mastery-agent
# Focus: Master development environment setup
```

### Intermediate: Pair Coordination
```bash
# Debug + Testing pair for quality focus
organized-agents coordinate debug-mastery testing-revolution
# Focus: Comprehensive quality assurance
```

### Advanced: Team Orchestration
```bash
# Full architecture team
organized-agents orchestrate \
  --team architecture \
  --agents codebase-mastery,documentation-revolution,environmental-mastery \
  --coordinator parallel-planning
```

### Expert: Full Orchestra
```bash
# All agents, full coordination
organized-agents symphony \
  --all-agents \
  --conductor parallel-planning \
  --communications connection-mastery \
  --fallback gemini-orchestrator
```
